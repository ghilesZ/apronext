# Apronext
This package provides an extension for the [OCaml
interface](https://antoinemine.github.io/Apron/doc/api/ocaml/index.html)
of the [apron library](https://github.com/antoinemine/apron).  It is
meant to make its use easier, efficiency is not the purpose.

Documentation is available [here](https://ghilesz.github.io/apronext/apronext/index.html)

It provides several utilities, such as higher order functions over the
different ````earray```` types, plus a large set of constructors meant
to make your life easier.
